The interaction xref:job-services/core-concepts.adoc#integration-with-the-workflows[between the workflows and the Job Service] is handled by the different Job Service Quarkus Extensions. Each extension is designed to work with a different communication alternative.

For example, you can select if your workflows must interact with the Job Service by sending <<kogito-addons-quarkus-knative-eventing, knative events>>, <<kogito-addons-quarkus-jobs-messaging, kafka messages>>, or simply by executing <<kogito-addons-quarkus-jobs-management, REST>> calls.

Finally, for the interaction work, you must configure your Quarkus Workflow Project with extension of your choice.

We recommend that you follow this procedure:

1. Identify the communication alternative that best fits your scenario.
2. Be sure that the Job Service is properly configured to support that alternative. This is very important if you want to use xref:job-services/core-concepts.adoc#knative-eventing[knative events] or xref:job-services/core-concepts.adoc#kafka-messaging[kafka messages] to communicate with it.
3. Configure your Quarkus Workflow Project with the corresponding extension.

[#kogito-addons-quarkus-knative-eventing]
== Knative eventing interaction

To interact with the Job Service by sending knative evens you must:

. Add the `kogito-addons-quarkus-knative-eventing` extension to your Quarkus Workflow Project.

.Maven dependency to add the `kogito-addons-quarkus-knative-eventing` extension.
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.kie.kogito</groupId>
    <artifactId>kogito-addons-quarkus-knative-eventing</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

[start=2]
. Maven build your project and locate the automatically generated `kogito.yml` and `knative.yml` resources in the `./target` directory.

[start=3]
. Install both resources to deploy your workflow

[source, bash]
----
kubectl apply -f ./target/kogito.yml

kubectl apply -f ./target/knative.yml
----
[NOTE]
====
If none of your workflows produce events, the `knative.yml` is not generated. In these cases you must only install the kogito.yml resource.
====

You can see a full example of this interaction mode configuration in the xref:use-cases/timeout-showcase-example.adoc#execute-quarkus-project-standalone-services[Quarkus Workflow Project with standalone services] example project.
